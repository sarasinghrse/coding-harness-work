"""Coding Agent Harness — LangGraph workflow with human-gated file edits.

Flow:
    START -> planner -> explorer -> coder
        -> (diffs proposed?) -> diff_review [interrupt] -> apply_diffs -> tester
        -> (no diffs)        -> tester
    tester -> (tests pass or max iterations) -> END
           -> (otherwise) -> coder

The diff_review node pauses the graph with LangGraph's `interrupt()` and
hands the pending change queue to the caller (CLI or Streamlit). The caller
resumes with `Command(resume={"decisions": {...}})` carrying per-diff
approve/reject decisions. Only approved diffs ever touch the disk.
